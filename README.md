# Monte Carlo Integration
Monte Carlo integration allows us to use simulation to make stochastic approximations of functions that do not have closed form solutions when integrated. I was mind blown to learn that this was a thing!! Since the integral is directly proportional to a known probability density. 

This project will cover:

## METHODS AND TECHNIQUES    
**Approximation of Integral**   
For this integral its is one that is difficult to integrate and has no closed-form solution. 

We begin by (as always) setting up a seed for reprodicibility.  
Define our function - we define the funtion we need to integrate   
Setting up the number of simulations we will use to generate n many random variables 
Evaluate function - we evaluate the function at each random variable
